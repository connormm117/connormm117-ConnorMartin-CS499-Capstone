# Connor Martin – CS499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

## Overview

This repository represents the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. It integrates enhanced artifacts from prior coursework to demonstrate growth across three core domains:

- Software Design and Engineering  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Database Architecture and Optimization  

Each artifact has been deliberately refactored and improved to reflect stronger architectural reasoning, improved efficiency, defensive programming practices, performance optimization, and a security-aware development mindset.

This capstone demonstrates progression from foundational implementation to production-quality, maintainable, and integrity-focused system design.

## Professional Focus

While completing this program, I have intentionally pursued a deep understanding of core computer science principles to support long-term goals in cybersecurity and secure systems engineering.

Rather than approaching cybersecurity from a tool-centric perspective, I focused on strengthening:

- Algorithmic reasoning and complexity analysis  
- Data structure selection and trade-offs  
- Software architecture and modular design  
- Relational database integrity and performance  
- Defensive programming and safe failure handling  

This portfolio reflects that foundation-first philosophy.

## Artifacts

### Enhancement 1 – Software Design & Engineering  
**Artifact:** Corner Grocer Frequency Analysis System  

Focus areas:
- Refactoring for modularity and maintainability  
- Reduction of duplicated logic  
- Improved input validation and defensive programming  
- Architectural improvements to support long-term scalability  

This enhancement emphasizes structural design decisions and clean software engineering practices.

### Enhancement 2 – Algorithms & Data Structures  
**Artifact:** Corner Grocer Frequency Analysis System  

Focus areas:
- Intentional use of `std::unordered_map` for O(1) average lookup  
- Deterministic sorting using `std::stable_sort`  
- Complexity analysis and trade-off evaluation  
- Performance-conscious data handling  

This enhancement demonstrates algorithmic reasoning and deliberate data structure selection.

### Enhancement 3 – Database Design & Optimization  
**Artifact:** Quantigration RMA Relational Database System  

Focus areas:
- Primary and foreign key enforcement  
- Referential integrity protection  
- Index optimization for performance  
- Enumerated constraints to prevent invalid state values  
- Safe arithmetic using NULLIF to prevent runtime errors  
- Decision-support SQL queries for stakeholder insight  

This enhancement reflects a security-aware and integrity-focused approach to relational database engineering.

---

## Security Mindset

Across all artifacts, I prioritized:

- Input normalization and validation  
- Referential integrity enforcement  
- Deterministic program behavior  
- Safe failure handling  
- Protection against invalid or inconsistent data  
- Performance-aware design decisions  

Security is not treated as an afterthought, but as an architectural consideration embedded into system design.
